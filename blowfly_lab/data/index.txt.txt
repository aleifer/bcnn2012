12620003.abf
First simultaneous extracellular recording of n3 nerve + intracellular recording of 1st muscle
This one has lots of activity in the intracellular recording



12620004.abf
Simulataneous but this time from a 2nd muscle
Starts at -67mV. The muscle recordings looks really sparce and clean.

12621005.abf
5 stimulations 6 seconds apart. 1 ms pulse. 10 V intoi crayfish.

12621006.abf
a few stimulations 3 seconds apart. 1 ms pulse. 10 V intoi crayfish.

12621007.abf
a few stimulations 1 seconds apart. 1 ms pulse. 10 V intoi crayfish.


12621008.abf
1/2 seconds apart. 1 ms pulse. 10 V intoi crayfish.


12621009.abf
200ms apart. 1 ms pulse. 10 V intoi crayfish.


12621010.abf
100ms apart. 1 ms pulse. 10 V intoi crayfish.

12621011.abf
50ms apart. 1 ms pulse. 10 V intoi crayfish.


-- rat brain slice data--
12621011.abf
5 second interval, 0.1 ms pulse width, 45 volt height. P13 pups.

12625003.abf
tetanus experiment: 100 Hz pulses for 1 second, with baseline measurements before and after.

--- Day 2---

Andy here. This is our second slice of the day
12626034.abf
Baseline. for The statistics file 12625000.sta from time 105860 s to 
OK. I'm ignoring that baseline. Because I feel like I had better bumps at the beginning.




12626039.abf is now our baseline.
12626042.ab is the post conditioning baseline. I see no evidence of LPT. However, everything is nice and reasonably situated around baseline.

whole cell rec,rests @ -60, shitty Rs....
stopwatch time 111922 is start of whole cell epsp stats baseline, rec# 12626045.abf

12626046 conditioning, 5x100 Hz @ 1 sec, 20 sec intervals

12626047 potentiations?!
 

--- Fly Stuff (first fly day)----
2nd July 2012 Monday
12702000.abf
Baseline Recordings from H1. 400ms forward and backward with blurry stripe stimulus. This was a good run at first but later ont eh signal dirfts in and out. I will add more salijne.  voltage on drum (proportional to speed) was 9.5 V.

12702001.abf
Much better baseline recording. (same as above but better)

12702002.abf
changed drum velocity to 7.5 V (forward and backwards)

12702003.abf
changed drum velocity to 5.5 V (forward and backwards)

12702004.abf
changed drum velocity to 3.5 V (forward and backwards)

12702005.abf
changed drum velocity to 1.5 V (forward and backwards)

12702006.abf
changed drum velocity to 0.5 V (forward and backwards)

12702007.abf
changed drum velocity to -0.5 V (effectively switching forward and backwards).  likely due to mechanical threshold for movement not being surpassed.

12702008.abf
changed drum velocity to -1.5 V (effectively switching forward and backwards)


12702009.abf
changed drum velocity to -2.5 V (effectively switching forward and backwards)

12702010.abf
drum velocity at 9.5 V again.  changed visual pattern to spatial chirp (roughly 1 cm to 1 mm pitch).  Chirp superperiod roughly 30 times the single run period.




===Blowfly Day 3==
w/ Frederico, Vivek and Andy
12704000.abf
10 second sweep, 1 increasing vertically-sized stripe band on gray background. 
Sounds pretty good.

1204001.abf
same as before, but this time there are 2 horizontal stripes that increase vertically as you go across horizontally (and the vertical sum of the stripe has the same area as the previous stripe)

1204002.abf
same as before, but this time there are 3 horizontal stripes that increase vertically as you go across horizontally (and the vertical sum of the stripe has the same area as the previous stripe)

1204003.abf
Control run with 1 stripe. Same as 12704000.
